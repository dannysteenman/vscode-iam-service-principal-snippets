## Features

1. **Auto-completion for AWS Service Principals**: Provides intelligent auto-completion suggestions for AWS Service Principals when defining IAM policies or roles.
2. **Context-aware Suggestions**: The extension intelligently detects when you're working with IAM policies or roles and only suggests Service Principal completions in relevant contexts.
3. **Supports Multiple Languages**: Supports auto-completion for Service Principals in JSON, YAML, Terraform, and AWS CDK (TypeScript, and Python).

## Usage

1. Install the "AWS IAM Service Principal Snippets" extension in VS Code.
2. Open or create a new file (`.json`, `.yml`, `.tf`, `.ts`, or `.py`) where you're defining IAM policies or roles.
3. When you reach a point where you need to specify a Service Principal (e.g., `Principal` key in JSON/YAML policies, `assumed_by` parameter in Python roles, etc.), start typing the name of the AWS service.
4. The extension will provide auto-completion suggestions for matching AWS Service Principals.
5. Select the desired Service Principal to insert it into your code.

Example of auto-completion in action:

> **Note:** If auto-completion doesn't trigger automatically, press `Ctrl+Space` (or `Cmd+Space` on macOS) to manually invoke IntelliSense.
